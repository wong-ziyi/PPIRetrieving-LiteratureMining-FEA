### 1. Retrieving possible O-GlcNAcylated proteins that correlated with Runx2 expression and the corresponding functional enrichment analysis
Linear and nonlinear correlations were determined using Pearson's correlation and Spearman's correlation, respectively, among all O-GlcNAc bands, Runx2, and OGT using GraphPad Prism 8 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to show the different O-GlcNAcylation patterns among DMSO, OSMI-1, and Thiamet-G groups. Since the role of Runx2 in osteoblast differentiation is well documented, the possible O-GlcNAcylated proteins with a similar molecular weight (MW) to the Runx2-correlated O-GlcNAc bands were used for a bioinformatic analysis to screen key candidate genes or signaling pathways for O-GlcNAcylation-mediated osteoblast differentiation.

Protein network data (scored links between proteins) was downloaded from the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database (STRING)37 that provides comprehensive information on the functional interactions among quired proteins. Using a minimum required interaction score of 0.500 (relative higher confidence), the proteins directly associated with Runx2 were retrieved (219 proteins). Then the proteins that its predicted MW within the MW range of Runx2-correlated O-GlcNAc bands were selected (124 proteins) to check that whether or not these proteins could be O-GlcNAcylated using O-GlcNAcAtlas (https://oglcnac.org/). O-GlcNAcAtlas is the first comprehensive, and curated database encapsulating experimentally identified O-GlcNAc sites and proteins in the past 35 years (since its discovery in the early 1980s).

After searching the O-GlcNAcAtlas database, 34 proteins have recorded the O-GlcNAc site. A literature mining of the PubMed database was applied to these 34 proteins to extract the proteins that highly correlated with osteoblast differentiation. A variable R was imported to evaluate the correlation between the retrieved possible O-GlcNAcylated proteins and osteoblast differentiation by calculating the ratio of (osteoblast differentiation and quired protein-related articles)/(quired protein-related articles). We further applied p-value to statistically analyze the chance probability of co-occurrences of each protein and OD in at least k papers, as following:
